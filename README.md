# 8bit-adder-subtractor
This project implements an 8-bit Adder/Subtractor circuit using Verilog HDL and mode control logic on an FPGA board. It performs both addition and subtraction operations based on a control input signal:  Mode = 0 → Addition  Mode = 1 → Subtraction  The design was developed, simulated, and synthesized using Xilinx Vivado.
